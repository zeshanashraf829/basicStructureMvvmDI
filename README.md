# Android MVVM Starter Template with Dependency Injection
This repository provides a basic structure for any Android project, designed specifically for Android developers who want to start a new project with modern architecture and clean code practices. The codebase includes the MVVM architecture, Dependency Injection, RoomDB, Retrofit, and is written entirely in Kotlin.

# Features
- **1. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns, making the code easy to maintain and test.
- **2. Dependency Injection:** Integrated with a DI framework (e.g., Hilt or Dagger), helping manage dependencies efficiently.
- **3. RoomDB:** Built-in Room Database for handling local storage, making it easy to work with SQLite databases.
- **4. Retrofit:** Integrated for making network requests to REST APIs, simplifying network operations.
- **5. Coroutines:** Effective coroutine management for asynchronous tasks and efficient thread handling.
- **6. Kotlin Extensions:** Use of Kotlin extensions to reduce boilerplate code and make development faster.

# Quick Start
- **1. Clone the repository**
- **Open the project in Android Studio.**
- **Build the project and start developing** with the base structure already in place!

# How to Use
This repository is designed to let you start your project with your own requirements. Everything is already structured, and you can customize it as per your project's needs.
- **Dependency Injection** is handled, so all your dependencies will be injected where needed.
- **RoomDB** is included for local database needs, and **Retrofit** is integrated for network operations.
- You can use **Coroutines** for background tasks, allowing for more effective concurrency management.

# Built With
- **1. Kotlin:** Pure Kotlin code for the entire project.
- **2. Coroutines:** For efficient background and async operations.
- **3. Room:** Local database handling using Room.
- **4. Retrofit:** Simple API client for network requests.
- **5. Dependency Injection:** Makes the code more modular and testable.
